# Todo App Constitution

## Project Overview
This is the Todo Evolution project - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console App. The purpose of this phase is to create a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory, implementing all 5 Basic Level features using spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Phase I Requirements
- Build a command-line todo application that stores tasks in memory
- Implement all 5 Basic Level features: Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete
- Use spec-driven development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus
- Follow clean code principles and proper Python project structure

## Core Functionality
1. Add Task – Create new todo items
2. Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list
3. Update Task – Modify existing task details
4. View Task List – Display all tasks
5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status

## Technology Stack
- UV
- Python 3.13+
- Claude Code
- Spec-Kit Plus
