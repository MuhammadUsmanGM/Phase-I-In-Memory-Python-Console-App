- Adds a new task to the todo list
- Parameters:
  - title (required): The task title (1-200 characters)
  - description (optional): The task description (max 1000 characters)
- Returns: Task ID of the newly created task

### view_tasks()
- Retrieves all tasks from the todo list
- Returns: List of tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status

### update_task(task_id, title=None, description=None)
- Updates an existing task's title and/or description
- Parameters:
  - task_id (required): The ID of the task to update
  - title (optional): New title for the task
  - description (optional): New description for the task
- Returns: Boolean indicating success

### delete_task(task_id)
- Deletes a task from the todo list
- Parameters:

## Usage Examples

### In AI Agent Context:
```
user: "Add a task called 'Buy groceries'"
skill: add_task(title="Buy groceries")

user: "Show me all my tasks"
skill: view_tasks()

user: "Update task 1 to 'Buy milk and bread'"
skill: update_task(task_id=1, title="Buy milk and bread")

user: "Delete task 3"
skill: delete_task(task_id=3)

user: "Mark task 2 as complete"
skill: mark_task_complete(task_id=2)
```

## Business Rules
- Task titles must be 1-200 characters
- Task descriptions must be max 1000 characters
- All operations are performed in-memory (no persistence between sessions)
- Task IDs are auto-incrementing integers

## Implementation
This skill interfaces with the in-memory storage system implemented in the Todo Console App, making the same operations available programmatically to AI agents.
